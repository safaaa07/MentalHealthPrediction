<h3>Prediction of Mental Health Issues</h3>

<p>This project was done as part of a class assignment. The main goal of the project was to get to know the dataset we are working with, wich you can find in the folder "input". The project was more focused on cleaning the data before moving to the comparison of some algorithms in predicting mental heanth issues.</p>
<p>The ML algorithms used for this work are the following : 
  <ul>
    <li> Naive Bayes</li>
    <li>Random Forest</li>
    <li>Decision Tree</li>
    <li>K-Nearest Neighbors</li>
    <li>Logistic Regression</li>
   </ul>
</p>
